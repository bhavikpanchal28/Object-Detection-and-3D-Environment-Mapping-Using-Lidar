# Object-Detection-and-3D-Environment-Mapping-Using-Lidar

These are a few files from my Final year Capstone Project based on 3D Environment Mapping and Obstacle Detection using the Intel RealSense L515 Lidar. \
The files here are the main obstacle detection system, the 3D environment mapping system, the complete final report of this project, the final PowerPoint created for our final presentation of the project, and a display poster that was created to explain and promote the project. \
